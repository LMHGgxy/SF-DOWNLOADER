The provided code is a Python script that allows you to download songs from a Spotify playlist using the Spotify API and the pytube library to find and download audio versions of songs from YouTube.

</div>

## installation

```bash
pip3 install spotipy
```
```bash
pip3 install pytube
```
```bash
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

- After having installed these 3 libraries, we create an application in "[Spotify Creator](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create)", we copy our `CLIENT_ID` and our `CLIENT_SECRET`
- we go to the `.env` file to add our `CLIENT_ID` and our `CLIENT_SECRET`

## execution
to execute the script we only put `python spotify.py` :)!!!.
